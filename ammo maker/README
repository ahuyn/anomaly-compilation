Replaces ammo recipes with custom ones.

Ammo now decomposes into 3 major components - casings, powder, and bullets.

Disassembly now yields variable amounts of components. Good ammo yields more components, but it is overall less and random.

Optionals:

bas_ammo: Integrates BAS ammo into the addon (20x70 buck, 23x75 shrapnel/barricade/dart, 9x21 SP10, .338 Fed). Needs testing!
no recipes mode: Removes unlock requirement for recipes.

Changelog

1.3 - Support for BAS ammo and generic ammo from other addons
1.2 - New icons courtesy of Maid
1.1 - Parts are always spawned in actor inventory (spawn in box has issues). Used less efficient and more consistent formula for spawning ammo.
