Adds in-game items to save the game. An economy-based alternative to ironman.

There are two primary items.

First is the flash drive. This allows you to make hard saves of your character. Using a flash drive creates a timestamped save of your character. You start with five (will be given for free on start or installation) and randomly acquire them as tasks are completed.

Second is the Hasty Preservation drink. This drink can be crafted cheaply and provides the effects of water and a bit more. Using this creates one (1) quicksave. Drinking it again will override the created quicksave.

Note that saves are based on your character's name. If you name two characters the same name, I can't guarantee your saves won't be overwritten.
