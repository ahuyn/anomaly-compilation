# Streamlined kits

Streamlines the upgrade system by replacing all kits with generic versions.

Tired of needing to collect a bajillion upgrade kits that bloat your inventory? Not enjoying figuring out how to determine if Advanced Bootstrapping kit installs the artifact container or the sprint speed on your suit? This is the addon for you!


All weapon and outfit upgrade kits are now compressed into six types, three for weapons, three for outfits:

# NOTE

The old kits will not be usable. Conversion is required into the new kits.

# Acquisition

Combine any three kits of the same tier into one of the new one, Just right click and combine away.

Higher tier kits (Advanced/Fine tuning) can be obtained by combining three of the previous tier. This can be done in inventory. Additionally, any higher tier kit can be downgraded into the next tier, but this is a 1:1 replacement.
