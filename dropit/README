Small addon that adds sliders for outfit drop chances.

You can customize the outfit drop chance for each outfit type. The default is:
Light: 70%
Medium: 50%
Heavy: 30%
Exo: 10%

Helmets are unaffected.

Works with Full and Progressive Outfit Drops.

Works best with MCM. Otherwise, change the default_chance in the script.

1.2.1 - Compatibility with Loot Overhaul (don't ask)
1.2 - Now drops parts when outfits don't drop. More sliders.
