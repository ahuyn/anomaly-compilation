Compilation of small addons I used as a testbed to develop new techniques for creating addons.

These are mostly conflict-free - streamlined upgrades has some conflicts with fetch_list and upgrades and will interfere with any addons that modify quests or tasks.

## AMMO MAKER

Balanced ammo crafting. Get a proportionate and infuriatingly small amount of components from each box of ammo. Ammo crafting is streamlined into four overarching types.

## STREAMLINED UPGRADES

Removes the bloat from upgrade kits and streamlines everything into six types (3 for outfit, 3 for weapon)

## REMOTE IED

Allows you to upgrade IEDs with remote triggers and detonate them remotely, as well as disarming any planted bombs for recovery.

## OUTFIT CHANCE TO DROP

The beloved balanced drops addon, now part of the family. Customizable drop chances for outfits and helmets.

## ITEM SAVES

Adds items to save your game, earned by completing tasks and through crafting.

## TOOLKIT WORKSHOP

Enables the craft (and only the craft) menu from toolkits.
