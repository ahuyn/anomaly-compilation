Adds remote IEDs and remote detonators.

Detonators

Detonators come in two flavors, homemade and military. Homemade detectors are cheaply craftable but have a short range and are unreliable. Military detectors are available from all traders starting at rep level 3. Detonators can be put in the quickslot bar and used from there.

Disarmer

I have also included a disarmer device that converts any planted IEDs into usable bombs that you can pick up. For balance issues remote IEDs are converted back to normal ones. The disarmer can be crafted.

Remote IEDs

IEDs can be upgraded to remote IEDs with some junk. In addition, there are new recipes for normal IEDs.

To use a remote IED, use the 'plant with remote trigger' option. When the mine is IED, use a detonator to blow the IED up.

You can at any time remove the remote trigger to convert the IED back into an ordinary IED.
